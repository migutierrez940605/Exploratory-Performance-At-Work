# Exploratory-Performance-At-Work
In this project, I explored the “performance at work” data to find insights about my performance in Compassionate Family Medicine. I calculated some measures and added them to new columns, I classified and segregated my performance through rating scales as “Efficient”, “Outstanding” and “Subpar” to use in visualization software.
