# Exploratory-Performance-At-Work
In this project, I explored the “performance at work” data to find insights into the performance of a Chart Prepper at the Family Care Facility for 34 days. I calculated some measures and added them to new columns, I classified and segregated my performance through rating scales as “Efficient”, “Outstanding” and “Subpar” to use in visualization software.
